    <string name="answer1">A1. This application was made through Android Studio.

    <string name="question2">Q2. How hard is android development?</string>
    <string name="answer2">A2. Personally, I found it to be quite easy. The fact that I did Web Development before this actually made this a lot easier. I did not have any trouble in making this application and actually enjoyed the process.</string>
    <string name="question3">Q3. Are we going to see any new applications from you moving forward?</string>
    <string name="answer3">A3. Probably not, as android development is not my main interest as of right now. But hey, never say never. I might develop a really cool application with an awesome UI later somewhere down the line, but as of right now, I have more important things to focus on.</string>
